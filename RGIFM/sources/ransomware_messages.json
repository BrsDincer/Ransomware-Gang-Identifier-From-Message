Moreover, we have taken a great amount of your corporate data prior to encryption.\n\n\n\nWell, for now let's keep all the tears and resentment to ourselves and try to build a constructive dialogue. We're fully aware of what damage we caused by locking your internal sources. At the moment, you have to know:\n\n\n\n1. Dealing with us you will save A LOT due to we are not interested in ruining your financially. We will study in depth your finance, bank & income statements, your savings, investments etc. and present our reasonable demand to you. If you have an active cyber insurance, let us know and we will guide you how to properly use it. Also, dragging out the negotiation process will lead to failing of a deal.\n\n2. Paying us you save your TIME, MONEY, EFFORTS and be back on track within 24 hours approximately. Our decryptor works properly on any files or systems, so you will be able to check it by requesting a test decryption service from the beginning of our conversation. If you decide to recover on your own, keep in mind that you can permanently lose access to some files or accidently corrupt them - in this case we won't be able to help.\n\n3. The security report or the exclusive first-hand information that you will receive upon reaching an agreement is of a great value, since NO full audit of your network will show you the vulnerabilities that we've managed to detect and used in order to get into, identify backup solutions and upload your data.\n\n4. As for your data, if we fail to agree, we will try to sell personal information/trade secrets/databases/source codes - generally speaking, everything that has a value on the darkmarket - to multiple threat actors at ones. Then all of this will be published in our blog - https://akiral2iz6a7qgd3ayp3l6yub7xx2uep76idk3u2kollpj5z3z636bad.onion.\n\n5. We're more than negotiable and will definitely find the way to settle this quickly and reach an agreement which will satisfy both of us.\n\n\n\nIf you're indeed interested in our assistance and the services we provide you can reach out to us following simple instructions:\n\n\n\n1. Install TOR Browser to get access to our chat room - https://www.torproject.org/download/.\n\n2. Paste this link - https://akiralkzxzq2dsrzsrvbr2xgbbu2wgsmxryd4csgfameg52n7efvr2id.onion.\n\n3.

Do not delete or modify encrypted files, it will lead to problems with decryption of files!\n\n\n\n>>>>> Don't go to the police or the FBI for help and don't tell anyone that we attacked you. \n\nThey won't help and will only make things worse for you. In 3 years not a single member of our group has been caught by the police, we are top notch hackers and we never leave a trail of crime. The police will try to prohibit you from paying the ransom in any way. The first thing they will tell you is that there is no guarantee to decrypt your files and remove stolen files, this is not true, we can do a test decryption before paying and your data will be guaranteed to be removed because it is a matter of our reputation, we make hundreds of millions of dollars and are not going to lose our revenue because of your files. It is very beneficial for the police and FBI to let everyone on the planet know about your data leak because then your state will get the fines budgeted for you due to GDPR and other similar laws. The fines will be used to fund the police and the FBI, they will eat more sweet coffee donuts and get fatter and fatter. The police and the FBI don't care what losses you suffer as a result of our attack, and we will help you get rid of all your problems for a modest sum of money. Along with this you should know that it is not necessarily your company that has to pay the ransom and not necessarily from your bank account, it can be done by an unidentified person, such as any philanthropist who loves your company, for example, Elon Musk, so the police will not do anything to you if someone pays the ransom for you. If you're worried that someone will trace your bank transfers, you can easily buy cryptocurrency for cash, thus leaving no digital trail that someone from your company paid our ransom. The police and FBI will not be able to stop lawsuits from your customers for leaking personal and private information. The police and FBI will not protect you from repeated attacks. Paying the ransom to us is much cheaper and more profitable than paying fines and legal fees.\n\n\n\n>>>>> What are the dangers of leaking your company's data.\n\nFirst of all, you will receive fines from the government such as the GDRP and many others, you can be sued by customers of your firm for leaking information that was confidential. Your leaked data will be used by all the hackers on the planet for various unpleasant things. For example, social engineering, your employees' personal data can be used to re-infiltrate your company. Bank details and passports can be used to create bank accounts and online wallets through which criminal money will be laundered. On another vacation trip, you will have to explain to the FBI where you got millions of dollars worth of stolen cryptocurrency transferred through your accounts on cryptocurrency exchanges. Your personal information could be used to make loans or buy appliances. You would later have to prove in court that it wasn't you who took out the loan and pay off someone else's loan. Your competitors may use the stolen information to steal technology or to improve their processes, your working methods, suppliers, investors, sponsors, employees, it will all be in the public domain. You won't be happy if your competitors lure your employees to other firms offering better wages, will you? Your competitors will use your information against you. For example, look for tax violations in the financial documents or any other violations, so you have to close your firm. According to statistics, two thirds of small and medium-sized companies close within half a year after a data breach. You will have to find and fix the vulnerabilities in your network, work with the customers affected by data leaks. All of these are very costly procedures that can exceed the cost of a ransomware buyout by a factor of hundreds. It's much easier, cheaper and faster to pay us the ransom. Well and most importantly, you will suffer a reputational loss, you have been building your company for many years, and now your reputation will be destroyed.\n\n\n\nRead more about the GDRP legislation::\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation\n\nhttps://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/\n\nhttps://gdpr-info.eu/\n\n\n\n>>>>> Don't go to recovery companies, they are essentially just middlemen who will make money off you and cheat you. \n\nWe are well aware of cases where recovery companies tell you that the ransom price is 5 million dollars, but in fact they secretly negotiate with us for 1 million dollars, so they earn 4 million dollars from you. If you approached us directly without intermediaries you would pay 5 times less, that is 1 million dollars.\n\n\n\n>>>> Very important! For those who have cyber insurance against ransomware attacks.\n\nInsurance companies require you to keep your insurance information secret, this is to never pay the maximum amount specified in the contract or to pay nothing at all, disrupting negotiations. The insurance company will try to derail negotiations in any way they can so that they can later argue that you will be denied coverage because your insurance does not cover the ransom amount. For example your company is insured for 10 million dollars, while negotiating with your insurance agent about the ransom he will offer us the lowest possible amount, for example 100 thousand dollars, we will refuse the paltry amount and ask for example the amount of 15 million dollars, the insurance agent will never offer us the top threshold of your insurance of 10 million dollars. He will do anything to derail negotiations and refuse to pay us out completely and leave you alone with your problem. If you told us anonymously that your company was insured for $10 million and other important details regarding insurance coverage, we would not demand more than $10 million in correspondence with the insurance agent. That way you would have avoided a leak and decrypted your information. But since the sneaky insurance agent purposely negotiates so as not to pay for the insurance claim, only the insurance company wins in this situation. To avoid all this and get the money on the insurance, be sure to inform us anonymously about the availability and terms of insurance coverage, it benefits both you and us, but it does not benefit the insurance company. Poor multimillionaire insurers will not starve and will not become poorer from the payment of the maximum amount specified in the contract, because everyone knows that the contract is more expensive than money, so let them fulfill the conditions prescribed in your insurance contract, thanks to our interaction.\n\n\n\n>>>>> If you do not pay the ransom, we will attack your company again in the future.\n",

For those who have cyber insurance against ransomware attacks.\nInsurance companies require you to keep your insurance information secret, this is to never pay the maximum amount specified in the contract or to pay nothing at all, disrupting negotiations.\nThe insurance company will try to derail negotiations in any way they can so that they can later argue that you will be denied coverage because your insurance does not cover the ransom amount.\nFor example your company is insured for 10 million dollars, while negotiating with your insurance agent about the ransom he will offer us the lowest possible amount, for example 100 thousand dollars, we will refuse the paltry amount and ask for example the amount of 15 million dollars, the insurance agent will never offer us the top threshold of your insurance of 10 million dollars.\nHe will do anything to derail negotiations and refuse to pay us out completely and leave you alone with your problem.

EXPLANATION OF THE SITUATION\n2.1 HOW DID THIS HAPPEN\nThe security of your IT perimeter has been compromised (it's not perfect at all). \nWe encrypted your workstations and servers to make the fact of the intrusion visible and to prevent you from hiding critical data leaks.\nWe spent a lot of time researching and finding out the most important directories of your business, your weak points. \nWe have already downloaded a huge amount of critical data and analyzed it. Now its fate is up to you, it will either be deleted or sold, or shared with the media.\n2.2 VALUABLE DATA WE USUALLY STEAL:\n                            - Databases, legal documents, personal information.\n                            - Audit reports.\n                            - Any financial documents (Statements, invoices, accounting, transfers etc.).\n                            - Work files and corporate correspondence.\n                            - Any backups.\n\t\t\t    - Confidential documents.\n2.3 TO DO LIST (best practies)\n                            - Contact us as soon as possible.\n                            - Contact us only in our live chat, otherwise you can run into scammers.\n                            - Purchase our decryption tool and decrypt your files. There is no other way to do this.\n                            - Realize that dealing with us is the shortest way to success and secrecy.\n                            - Give up the idea of using decryption help programs, otherwise you will destroy the system permanently.\n                            - Avoid any third-party negotiators and recovery groups. They can become the source of leaks.\n--------------------------------------------------------\n                                  3.

        "---\n\nHi dears! This is TommyLeaks team and it is pleasure for us to inform you that your company network has been breached. We have stolen your files and documents and exfiltrated only the most sensitive and useful information from that.\n\nFirst of all, remain calm and do not undertake any hasty actions at that moment if you want to save your reputation and avoid any bad scenarios:\n- do not go to the authorities. They will perhaps confiscate your PCs and other IT equipment and will not prevent the process of your data leaking (hundred percent);\n- do not contact any recovery agencies. They will just make money from your incident and of course try to cheat you. You will not save money at this case. It is better and cheaper for you to communicate with us on your own.\n\nWe're here not to rob you and won't be trying to intimidate you, we're just interested in helping you to rebuild your security infrastructure and be safe further. But of course our services cost money. How much? Will be known once we check your finance. We aren't going to ask for too much, so please do not try to bargain with us with no worthy arguments. Remember that all your files are in front of us.\n\nAs for the guarantees, we are committed to provide you with deletion log, breach report and other necessary materials once we receive the payment. We work for reputation and do not want some victim to spread any bad gossips about us or something, so be sure that the deal will be clean and honest. We guarantee that we will not attack your network again after payment but we will return in case deal falling through.\n\nOnce you are ready to move to the payment stage, there are some recommendations on how to do this securely:\n- if you go to the bank to take a loan or just withdraw your funds, tell the bank that you need this money for the investment purposes only;\n- if you have some troubles gaining bitcoins, just go to any exchange platform (coinbase.com, for instance) or a local broker to buy BTC from them for cash. That way no authorities or researchers do not trace your bank transfers. You may also go to the third party person who may make a transfer instead of you. \n\nSo, that's it. And finally to contact us use this link - https://xir242nunyist4d7ksfnfmhnjx4gvqbuzo7eax4o3abqjesbxjshh4qd.onion/\nYou have to open the link only in TOR Browser (download it here: https://www.torproject.org).
